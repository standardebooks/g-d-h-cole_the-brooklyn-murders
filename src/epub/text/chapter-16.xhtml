<p>Fred Thomas came away a good deal dissatisfied from
his discussion with his client. Walter Brooklyn, he felt,
had given him little enough to go upon. He persisted in
affirming that he had not been in Liskeard House that night,
and in denying absolutely that he had either rung up his Club
and given a message or left his walking-stick in Prinsep’s room.
Yet surely, Thomas argued, the police, if they had proceeded
to the drastic step of an arrest, must have some definite proof
that he had been in the house, or at any rate some clear
indication of his complicity. He did not believe that his client
was being frank with him; and, while he had not said this
outright, a hint of what he thought had produced a violent
outburst of bad temper from Brooklyn, and almost caused
him to tell his legal adviser to clear out and come back no
more. This had served to confirm Thomas’s idea that
Brooklyn was lying, and his thought, as he went away, was that, if
he tried again, probably Brooklyn would tell him the truth
when he cooled down and came to realise more fully what his
position was. In his experience imprisonment had a
wonderfully sobering effect. Meanwhile, Thomas made up his mind
to see Carter Woodman, and try to find out from him more
definitely how matters stood. Woodman, presumably, would
want Walter Brooklyn to get off, even if he believed him to be
guilty. He would probably not want a member of the
Brooklyn family to be convicted of murder, whatever the truth
might be.</p>

<p>Thomas had not long left Walter Brooklyn when Joan
arrived to see him. She had come into the police-station alone,
leaving Lucas and Ellery outside in the car to wait for her
return. While they waited, Ellery told his guardian more
about his engagement to Joan, and received from him very
hearty congratulations. “You didn’t take my advice, my boy,”
Lucas said; “but now that things have come out right, I’m
most heartily glad that you didn’t. I have hoped for this
for a long time. I’m very fond of you both, and I can see
there’s no doubt about your being fond of each other.” Which
was very pleasant hearing for Ellery; for he had a great
liking for his guardian, and he knew that his friendly
countenance would be likely to stand him in good stead with Sir
Vernon Brooklyn, of whom he was more than a little afraid.
“You must back me up with Sir Vernon,” he said; and Lucas
readily promised his help.</p>

<p>It was three-quarters of an hour before Joan came out of
the police-station. She seemed well satisfied, smiling back at
the policeman who accompanied her to the door. “He has
told you?” asked Ellery, as he held open the door of the
car.</p>

<p>“What he had to tell,” Joan replied. “It was not very
much; but it makes everything different. Let us go back and
talk it over.”</p>

<p>Lucas drove straight back to Liskeard House, and there,
in Joan’s room, the three held a consultation. “He was not
here at all,” she told them. “I mean he did not come back
to the house on Tuesday night. The telephone message must
be all a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he knows nothing at all about it?”
asked Ellery.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that he knows nothing. He has told me
exactly what he did after leaving here and up to the time
when he went back to his Club.”</p>

<p>“You may think I ought not to ask this, Joan,” said Lucas;
“but are you quite sure of what you say?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely sure. He was telling me the truth, I know.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose,” Ellery put in, “we can produce witnesses
to prove that he was somewhere else when he was supposed to
be here. But who the devil did send that telephone message
if he did not?”</p>

<p>Lucas put in a word. “Never mind that for the moment.
The main thing now is to prove that he did not send it. Who
was with him and where was he?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s just the difficulty. He has told me exactly
where he went; but I don’t see how we can find any one to
prove it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he was alone all the time, and no one
saw him?” asked Ellery.</p>

<p>“Well, not quite that; but something very like it, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>Then Joan was allowed to tell her story. Walter
Brooklyn, after being refused an interview with Sir Vernon, had
left Liskeard House at about a quarter past ten. He had
stopped for a minute or two outside the Piccadilly Theatre,
wondering what to do next. Then he had walked slowly along
Piccadilly and into the Circus. There again he had hung
about for a few minutes, and had then gone slowly along
Coventry Street as far as Leicester Square. He had walked
round the Square, and outside the Alhambra had stopped for
a few minutes to talk to a woman of his acquaintance—“not at
all a nice woman, I am afraid,—and he knows no more
about her than that her name is Kitty, and that she is often to
be found about there. He doesn’t even know her surname.
It was about a quarter to eleven when he met her.”</p>

<p>Then he had gone on past the Hippodrome and up Charing
Cross Road as far as Cambridge Circus. He had stopped
for a few minutes outside the Palace, but had not spoken to
any one, and then he had walked down Shaftesbury Avenue
and back into Piccadilly Circus. In Cambridge Circus he had
lighted a cigar with his last match; but it had gone out. Just
outside the Monico he had stopped a man he did not know—“fellow
came out of the place, he looked like a waiter, don’t
you know”—and had borrowed a match and re-lighted his
cigar. Then he had crossed the Circus again, and walked
back down Piccadilly as far as the turning leading to Liskeard
House. He had half a mind, he said, to go in and ask to see
Prinsep; but after hanging about for a few minutes he had
given up the idea, crossed the road, and walked down St.
James’s Street with the idea of looking in at his other Club.
But he had decided not to go in, and had walked past the
door down Pall Mall and into Trafalgar Square. At the
top of Whitehall he had looked at his watch, and the time
had been 11.45. Just before that, he had hung over the
parapet on the National Gallery side of the Square for
a minute or two; but he had no conversation with any
one. On leaving the Square, he turned up Regent Street and
made his way, walking a good deal faster, along Jermyn
Street and up St. James’s Street, and so back to his Club in
Piccadilly. He had thus again passed Liskeard Street, but on
the opposite side of the road. When he got in, he had gone
straight to bed.</p>

<p>This account of Walter Brooklyn’s movements was quite
convincing to Joan and her two listeners; but they had to
admit that there was not much in it to persuade others of its
truth. According to his own account, he must have been in
the neighbourhood of Liskeard House at 11.30 when the ’phone
message was supposed to have been sent; and not one of his
movements between 10.15 and midnight seemed to be at all easy
to confirm by any independent testimony. When Joan had
finished her narrative, they all felt that, if Walter Brooklyn’s
vindication was to depend on an <i>alibi</i>, his chances were not
particularly good. Still, if he had not been in the house, the
police could after all have very little against him beyond a
suspicion.</p>

<p>At this point Mary Woodman came into the room to say
that Sir Vernon would be very pleased if Mr. Lucas would
come and sit with him for a while, and Lucas, promising to
obey her order to be very quiet and not to allow the patient to
excite himself, was led off to the sick room.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Joan,” said Ellery, who had been sitting
still, with a prodigious frown on his face, trying to think the
thing over, “we’ve jolly well got to establish that <i>alibi</i>. We
don’t know what else the police may have; but we’re safe
enough if we can prove that he wasn’t here that evening.
Unless we can establish positively that he wasn’t there, the
circumstantial evidence will go down with a jury.”</p>

<p>“But how can we establish it? I only wish we could.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to. We’re going to find those people he spoke
to, and we’re going to hunt London for people who saw him
strolling about. After all, he’s very well known, and lots of
people must have seen him. I know we shall be able to prove
he’s telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“You’re a dear to say so, and I don’t see what we can do
but try. How do you propose to set about it?”</p>

<p>“First of all, I propose that we make a map of the
wanderings of Ulysses—shall we call it?—showing exactly where
he went, whom he spoke to and when, and so on. That will
help us to see exactly what’s the best way of getting to work.”</p>

<p>So Ellery took a sheet of paper, and they sat down side by
side at the table. Under Joan’s directions, Ellery made a map
of Walter Brooklyn’s journeyings on Tuesday evening. It
took an hour to do, and this is what it looked like when it was
done, with notes to help them in prosecuting their inquiries.</p>

<p>“It isn’t very hopeful, I’m afraid,” said Joan, as they
looked together at the finished plan; “but I’m afraid it is
all we have to go upon.”</p>

<p>“Not quite all, I hope. Did he tell you what the man
he spoke to looked like—I mean the chap who gave him a
match outside the Monico?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was a tall, dark man, clean-shaven and very blue
in the chin, wearing a long black overcoat and a squash hat.
And he almost certainly had some trouble of the eyes. He
wore glasses; but he kept blinking all the time behind them.”</p>

<p>“That ought to help. Now what about this woman, Kitty?
What is she like?”</p>

<p>“He says she is about forty, but dresses—and paints—to
look younger. She’s getting fat, has bright golden
hair—certainly dyed—and wears a great many rings. She’s fairly
tall, and walks with a bit of a waddle. Her eyes are dark and
piercing, he says, and she has a smile that looks as if it
was switched on and off like an electric light.”</p>

<p>“I must say she doesn’t sound attractive.”</p>

<p>“But he says she is—extraordinarily; and, what is more,
she’s very well known. He has heard her other name, but
he can’t remember it. He thinks she has had several
surnames.”</p>

<p>“That seems to be all we can get to start with. What I
propose to do is to follow your stepfather’s route, trying to find
some one who saw him at each point where he stopped.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you can leave a bit of it to me. We know that
Marian and Helen and Carter all saw him coming here at
a few minutes past ten, and the servants here say he left at
about a quarter-past. He tells me he stopped outside the
theatre just after that. If so, some one very likely saw him.
I’ll see about that, and I’ll try to find out as well whether any
one saw him passing again later. He must have passed at about
11.20 to half-past—I mean when he stood at the corner of
Liskeard Street, and again just before twelve on his way back
to the Club.”</p>

<p>“Very well. You take this end and I’ll follow the rest
of his wanderings. And there is no reason why I shouldn’t
get to work at once. It will be best to go over the ground in
the evening, just as he did.”</p>

<p>They sat and talked of the case for a while longer; and
then they sat for a time without talking at all, happy in each
other’s presence despite the tragedy in which they were
involved. At length Ellery started up, saying that he must
go out and get some dinner, and then go to work seriously.</p>

<p>“And by the way, Joan,” he added, “why shouldn’t you
come out and have dinner with me? I’m sure Mary would
look after Sir Vernon.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, does it occur to you that I’ve left him
to himself for a good long time already—or rather left poor
Mary alone to look after him? I couldn’t have done it if
Marian had not promised to come in and help.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Mary wouldn’t mind,” Ellery began, pleading
with her to come.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, Mary’s an angel. She never minds
anything. But that’s no reason why she should be put upon.
No, my boy, you go and have your bachelor dinner, and I’ll
get Winter to send me up an egg.”</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I share the egg?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Get along with you.” And Joan sped
her lover on his way with the taste of her kiss fresh on his
mouth. It seemed a profanation to eat anything after that;
but all the same, while Joan ate her egg and then took her
turn in watching over Sir Vernon, Ellery, seated alone in the
grill room at Hatchett’s was making a very solid and
satisfactory meal. Somehow, love seemed to give one an appetite,
he reflected, as he lighted a cigar. Then he set forth upon
his quest, walking slowly down Piccadilly towards the Circus.
He had no fixed plan of action. As he put it to himself, he
was following the route Walter Brooklyn had taken and just
keeping his eyes open, in the hope that something might turn
up. Nothing did turn up till he reached Piccadilly Circus.
There, as he knew, Walter Brooklyn had hung about for a few
minutes, but had spoken to no one.</p>

<p>The quest certainly did not seem to be hopeful. Piccadilly
Circus was crowded with people, some hurrying this way or
that in pursuit of some definite object, others standing or
strolling about as if they had nothing to do and nowhere in
particular to go. The flower-women who sit on the island in the
middle of the Circus in the daytime had already left their
posts, and would presumably have done so on Tuesday
before Walter Brooklyn took that disastrous walk. But before
long Ellery picked out two persons who remained at fixed
spots while the rest of the crowd changed from minute to
minute. The one was a policeman regulating the traffic and
the queues at the point where the buses stopped by the island:
the other was a night-watchman in his little hut, keeping guard
over a piece of the roadway which was under repair. These
were the most likely of all the crowd to have been there on
Tuesday night, and with them he determined to begin his
inquiries.</p>

<p>The policeman was quickly disposed of. He had not been
on duty on Tuesday; but a little persuasion in tangible form
soon secured the name of the constable who had, and the news
that he had only been kept away that night by a
misadventure, and would be on duty again the following night. Ellery
made a note of the name, and said to himself that he must see
the other policeman later. For the present he strolled over
towards the watchman, whom he found reading a tattered book
in his little cabin, by the light partly of the lamps and sky
signs, and partly, though it was a warm summer evening, of
a blazing fire in a pail. He was a little, old man with a pair
of steel spectacles, which had carved a deep rut in his nose,
and he seemed to be reading with extraordinarily concentrated
attention. Ellery managed to see what the book was. It
was <i>Sartor Resartus</i>. The man was clearly a “scholar,” and
probably a homely philosopher of the working-class.</p>

<p>It seemed best to use the opening which providence had
provided. “That’s a fine book you’ve got there,” said Ellery,
casting his mind back to the days at school, when he had first
and last read his <i>Sartor</i>, only to forget all about it and Carlyle
as he reached years of discretion.</p>

<p>The little old man peered up at him over his glasses. “It
is <em>the</em> book for me,” he said. “That Carlyle, sir, he was a
man.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you manage to read a great deal at your job.”</p>

<p>“I do that. You see, I had a accident ten years ago.
’Fore that, I was a navvy; but that finished me—for heavy
work, I mean. At first, I was wretched at this job; the
company gave it me, when doctor said I was fit for light work.
And then it came to me I’d take up reading, like. I hadn’t
hardly ever opened a book till then—not since school. I can
tell you, it’s been a revelation to me. I don’t ask nothing
better than to sit here with a good book now. But it isn’t
often one of you gentlemen seems to notice what I’m reading.”</p>

<p>The old man spoke slowly, and rather as if he was thinking
aloud. He seemed almost to have forgotten that Ellery was
there.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shouldn’t have noticed, unless there had been
something I wanted to ask you. A man’s life may depend
on it, and I wanted your help.”</p>

<p>The old man peered up at him again, and a little gleam
of excitement came into his eyes; but he only nodded to
Ellery to go on.</p>

<p>Ellery handed him a photograph of Walter Brooklyn.
“On Tuesday night, at about half-past ten, that man stopped
for some minutes on the island in the middle of the Circus
here. He is accused of having been somewhere else, and
his life may depend on our finding some one who saw him
here. What I want to ask is whether you happened to notice
him.”</p>

<p>The old man thought for a minute before answering. “I
can’t say I did; but I seem to know his face somehow.
Half-past ten, you said?”</p>

<p>“Then or then abouts, it must have been.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see him. At half-past ten I was in here
reading, and I didn’t notice much. But I know I’ve seen that
chap somewhere. Wait a minute while I think.”</p>

<p>Ellery waited. It seemed a long while before the old
man went on.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’d have said half-past eleven, or maybe a
quarter-past, I should have said I saw him.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why, he did cross the Circus again at about that
time.”</p>

<p>“Then I saw him. It was like this, you see. About a
quarter-past eleven on Tuesday I gets up to walk round the
works here and see if all’s right. Up there at the corner by
Shaftesbury Avenue I saw a gentleman—very like your
gentleman he was and smoking a big cigar—come strolling
across the road. Very slow, he was walking. Seemed as if
he was annoyed about something—waving his stick in the
air, he was, as if he was making believe to hit somebody. I
only noticed him because a big motor-car came round
suddenly from Regent Street as he was crossing, and he had to
skip. Came straight into the ropes round the work up there.
I hurried to see if he was all right; but before I got there he
dusted himself down and walked on. I’m almost sure he
was your man. I’ve got a memory for faces, and I noticed
him particularly because he seemed that ratty, if I may say
so.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me again what time that was?”</p>

<p>“Not far short of half-past eleven—leastways it was after
the quarter, twenty to twenty-five past, maybe.”</p>

<p>Ellery congratulated himself on an extraordinary stroke of
luck. It was, of course, far more important to establish
Walter Brooklyn’s presence in Piccadilly Circus between
11.15 and 11.30 than at 10.30; but it had seemed impossible
to do so. Some one might have noticed him when he hung
about there for several minutes; but it seemed very unlikely
that his mere walking across the Circus at the later time could
have been confirmed. By a lucky chance it had been, and
the first link in the <i>alibi</i> had been successfully joined.</p>

<p>The next thing was to get the watchman’s name and address,
and to arrange for his appearance if he were called upon.
The old man readily gave the particulars; but when Ellery
talked of payment for his services, he refused. “I don’t want
money for it,” he said; “not unless I have to appear in court.
Then I’ll want my expenses same as another. But I’ll tell
you what. If I’ve done you a good turn, you come here
again some night and talk to me about books. That’ll be a
lot more to me than what you’d give me. There ain’t no
one I’ve got to talk to about what I read. It’ll be a treat to
have a talk to a gent like you, what knows all about books
and what’s inside ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Ellery, “you do me too much credit. It’s
years since I read Carlyle, and I’ve forgotten most about
him. But I’ll come back, and lend you some more of him
if you want it. But I expect you know a lot more about
him than I do.”</p>

<p>It turned out that what the old man wanted above all else
was a copy of Carlyle’s <i>Cromwell</i>. Ellery promised to bring
it, and after a few words more they parted on the best of
terms, and Ellery walked on slowly along Coventry Street and
into Leicester Square. He felt that luck was on his side.</p>
